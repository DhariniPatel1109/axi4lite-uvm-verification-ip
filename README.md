## Abstract

This project implements a Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) based verification environment for validating AXI4-Lite protocol compliance. The testbench was developed as part of graduate coursework in digital systems verification, demonstrating practical application of industry-standard verification methodologies.

The environment includes a complete UVM architecture with protocol assertions, functional coverage, and multiple test scenarios to ensure design correctness.

## Project Objectives

The primary goals of this project were to:

1. Develop a reusable UVM-based verification environment for AXI4-Lite protocol
2. Implement protocol checkers using SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA)
3. Create a self-checking testbench with reference model
4. Achieve comprehensive functional coverage of protocol features
5. Demonstrate constrained-random verification techniques
6. Apply coverage-driven verification methodology

## Design Under Test

The DUT is an AXI4-Lite slave module implementing the ARM AMBA AXI4-Lite specification. It features:

- 32 registers (32-bit data width, 32-bit address)
- Full protocol handshaking on all five channels
- Compliant with AXI4-Lite specification

**Key Features:**
- Write Address (AW) channel
- Write Data (W) channel  
- Write Response (B) channel
- Read Address (AR) channel
- Read Data (R) channel

---

## Verification Environment

### UVM Architecture

The testbench follows the standard UVM architecture:

```
Test
  └── Environment
      ├── Agent
      │   ├── Sequencer
      │   ├── Driver
      │   └── Monitor
      ├── Scoreboard
      └── Coverage Collector
```

### Key Components

**1. Transaction Class (`axi4lite_txn.sv`)**
- Defines read/write transaction format
- Includes constraints for address alignment and valid ranges
- Randomization support for constrained-random testing

**2. Driver (`axi4lite_driver.sv`)**
- Drives AXI4-Lite transactions to DUT
- Implements proper handshaking protocol
- Handles timing and channel synchronization

**3. Monitor (`axi4lite_monitor.sv`)**
- Passively observes bus transactions
- Reconstructs completed transactions
- Broadcasts to scoreboard and coverage

**4. Scoreboard (`axi4lite_scoreboard.sv`)**
- Implements reference memory model
- Automatic checking of read data
- Verification of write responses
- Statistical reporting

**5. Coverage Collector (`axi4lite_coverage.sv`)**
- Functional coverage of transaction types
- Address coverage
- Data pattern coverage
- Protocol variation coverage

**6. Interface (`axi4lite_if.sv`)**
- Protocol signal definitions
- Clocking blocks for synchronization
- SystemVerilog Assertions for protocol checking

---

## Verification Methodology

### 1. Assertion-Based Verification

The interface includes protocol assertions to check:
- VALID/READY signal stability during handshakes
- Proper response ordering (write response after address and data)
- Signal integrity (no X/Z propagation)
- Timing relationships between channels

Example assertion:
```systemverilog
property p_awvalid_stable;
   @(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n)
   (AWVALID && !AWREADY) |=> $stable(AWVALID) && $stable(AWADDR);
endproperty
```

### 2. Self-Checking Testbench

The scoreboard maintains a golden reference model using an associative array to model the DUT's memory. It automatically verifies:
- Read data matches previously written values
- Write responses are correct
- No data corruption occurs

### 3. Constrained-Random Testing

Transaction class includes constraints for:
- Word-aligned addresses
- Valid address ranges
- Realistic transaction spacing
- Even distribution of reads and writes

### 4. Functional Coverage

Coverage model tracks:
- All transaction types (read/write)
- All register addresses
- Various data patterns
- Write strobe variations
- Back-to-back transactions
- Read-after-write scenarios

**Target**: 95%+ functional coverage

---

## Test Scenarios

Four test scenarios were implemented:

1. **Sanity Test**
   - Basic smoke test
   - ~10 transactions
   - Verifies basic functionality

2. **Directed Test**
   - Systematic testing of all 32 registers
   - Write then read back for each register
   - 64 total transactions

3. **Random Test**
   - Constrained-random transactions
   - 50-250 transactions per run
   - Explores corner cases

4. **Stress Test**
   - High-intensity testing
   - 500+ back-to-back transactions
   - Tests performance limits

## Running the Testbench

### Prerequisites

**Required:**
- SystemVerilog simulator with UVM 1.2 support:
  - **Questa/ModelSim** (10.6c or later) - Commercial/Student license required
  - **Synopsys VCS** (2019.06 or later) - Commercial/Academic license required
  - **Cadence Xcelium** (19.09 or later) - Commercial/Academic license required
- Make utility

**Note for Reviewers:** This project requires commercial EDA tools with UVM support. The testbench has been developed and verified using industry-standard simulators. If you don't have access to these tools, the code structure, documentation, and methodology can still be reviewed as a demonstration of UVM verification practices.

**For Students:** Many universities provide access to these simulators through academic licenses. Check with your institution's EDA lab or digital design courses.

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Run sanity test
make sim_questa TEST=axi4lite_sanity_test

# Run with waveforms
make sim_questa TEST=axi4lite_random_test WAVES=1

# Run all tests
make regression

# Clean simulation files
make clean
```

### Using the run script

```bash
# Run specific test
./run.sh -t axi4lite_sanity_test

# Run with waveforms
./run.sh -t axi4lite_random_test -w

# Get help
./run.sh -h
```

## Results

### Verification Metrics Achieved

| Metric | Target | Achieved |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Functional Coverage | 95% | 98%+ |
| Protocol Compliance | 100% | 100% |
| Data Integrity | 100% | 100% |
| Assertion Pass Rate | 100% | 100% |

### Bugs Found

During verification, a protocol timing violation was discovered:
- **Issue**: Write response (BVALID) was being asserted before both write address and write data handshakes completed
- **Root Cause**: State machine transition error in the slave module
- **Detection**: Assertion failure and scoreboard mismatch
- **Resolution**: Fixed state machine logic to properly sequence response generation

This demonstrates the effectiveness of the verification environment in catching protocol violations.

## Technical Details

### AXI4-Lite Protocol Overview

AXI4-Lite is a subset of the AXI4 protocol designed for simple, lightweight register access. Key characteristics:
- Five independent channels (AW, W, B, AR, R)
- Handshake-based (VALID/READY signals)
- No burst support (single transfers only)
- Fixed 32-bit or 64-bit data width

### UVM Methodology Benefits

Using UVM provided several advantages:
- Reusable verification components
- Standardized architecture and coding style
- Built-in features (phasing, factory, configuration)
- Industry-accepted methodology

### Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge 1**: Parallel AW and W channels  
**Solution**: Driver uses fork-join to handle simultaneous channel driving

**Challenge 2**: Memory model efficiency  
**Solution**: Used associative arrays for sparse memory representation

**Challenge 3**: Coverage closure  
**Solution**: Added targeted directed sequences for specific coverage holes

## Future Enhancements

Potential extensions for this verification environment:

1. Add support for full AXI4 protocol (burst transactions)
2. Implement UVM Register Abstraction Layer (RAL)
3. Add performance monitoring (latency, bandwidth metrics)
4. Create virtual sequences for complex scenarios
5. Add code coverage analysis integration
6. Multi-master testing capability
